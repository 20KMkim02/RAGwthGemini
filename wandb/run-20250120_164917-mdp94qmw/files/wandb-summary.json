ALLAN QUATERMAIN. [1] Vulture. End of Project Gutenberg's King Solomon's Mines, by H. Rider Haggard\n\nheard about my brother's journey at Bamangwato?\" asked Sir Henry, as I paused to fill my pipe before replying to Captain Good. \"I heard this,\" I answered, \"and I have never mentioned it to a soul till to-day. I heard that he was starting for Solomon's Mines.\" \"Solomon's Mines?\" ejaculated both my hearers at once. \"Where are they?\" \"I don't know,\" I said; \"I know where they are said to be. Once I saw the peaks of the mountains that border them, but there were a hundred and thirty miles of desert between me and them, and I am not aware that any white man ever got across it save one. But perhaps the best thing I can do is to tell you the legend of Solomon's Mines as I know it, you passing your word not to reveal anything I tell you without my permission. Do you agree to that? I have my reasons for asking.\" Sir Henry nodded, and Captain Good replied, \"Certainly, certainly.\" \"Well,\" I began, \"as you may guess, generally speaking, elephant hunters are a rough set of men, who do not trouble themselves with much beyond the facts of life and the ways of Kafirs. But here and there you meet a man who takes the trouble to collect traditions from the natives, and tries to make out a little piece of the history of this dark land. It was such a man as this who first told me the legend of Solomon's Mines, now a matter of nearly thirty years ago. That was when I was on my first elephant hunt in the Matalebe country. His name was Evans, and he was killed the following year, poor fellow, by a wounded buffalo, and lies buried near the Zambesi Falls. I was telling Evans one\n\ndo with so much gold? Surely for the sake of it I should be murdered or ever I saw the coasts of Egypt.\" \"What shall I add then?\" asked the King. \"The most beauteous maiden in the House of Women?\" I shook my head. \"Not so, O King, for then I must marry who would remain single.\" \"There is no need, you might sell her to your friend, Peroa. A satrapy?\" \"Not so, O King, for then I must govern it, which would keep me from my hunting, until it pleased the King to take my head.\" \"By the name of the holy ones I worship what then do you ask added to the pearls and the pure gold?\" Now I tried to bethink me of something that the King could not grant, since I had no wish for this match which my heart warned me would end in trouble. As no thought came to me I looked at Bes and saw that he was rolling his eyes towards the six doomed hunters who were being led away, also in pretence of driving off a fly, pointing to them with one of the lion tails. Then I remembered that a decree once uttered by the King of the East could not be altered, and saw a road of escape. \"O King,\" I said, \"together with the pearls and the gold I ask that the lives of those six hunters be added to the wager, to be spared if by chance I should win.\" \"Why?\" asked the King amazed. \"Because they are brave men, O King, and I would not see the bones of such cracked by tame beasts in a cage.\" \"Is my judgment registered?\" asked the King. \"Not yet, O King,\" answered the head scribe. \"Then it has no\n\nbut the document?\" said Sir Henry, in a tone of deep interest. \"Yes, the document; what was in it?\" added the captain. \"Well, gentlemen, if you like I will tell you. I have never showed it to anybody yet except to a drunken old Portuguese trader who translated it for me, and had forgotten all about it by the next morning. The original rag is at my home in Durban, together with poor Dom José's translation, but I have the English rendering in my pocket-book, and a facsimile of the map, if it can be called a map. Here it is.\" [MAP OMITTED] \"I, José da Silvestra, who am now dying of hunger in the little cave here no snow is on the north side of the nipple of the southernmost of the two mountains I have named Sheba's Breasts, write this in the year 1590 with a cleft bone upon a remnant of my raiment, my blood being the ink. If my slave should find it when he comes, and should bring it to Delagoa, let my friend (name illegible) bring the matter to the knowledge of the king, that he may send an army which, if they live through the desert and the mountains, and can overcome the brave Kukuanes and their devilish arts, to which end many priests should be brought, will make him the richest king since Solomon. With my own eyes I have seen the countless diamonds stored in Solomon's treasure chamber behind the white Death; but through the treachery of Gagool the witch-finder I might bring nought away, scarcely my life. Let him who comes follow the map, and climb the snow of Sheba's left breast till he reaches the nipple, on the north side of which is the great road Solomon made, from\n\nKING X THE WITCH-HUNT XI WE GIVE A SIGN XII BEFORE THE BATTLE XIII THE ATTACK XIV THE LAST STAND OF THE GREYS XV GOOD FALLS SICK XVI THE PLACE OF DEATH XVII SOLOMON'S TREASURE CHAMBER XVIII WE ABANDON HOPE XIX IGNOSI'S FAREWELL XX FOUND KING SOLOMON'S MINES CHAPTER I I MEET SIR HENRY CURTIS It is a curious thing that at my age--fifty-five last birthday--I should find myself taking up a pen to try to write a history. I wonder what sort of a history it will be when I have finished it, if ever I come to the end of the trip! I have done a good many things in my life, which seems a long one to me, owing to my having begun work so young, perhaps. At an age when other boys are at school I was earning my living as a trader in the old Colony. I have been trading, hunting, fighting, or mining ever since. And yet it is only eight months ago that I made my pile. It is a big pile now that I have got it--I don't yet know how big--but I do not think I would go through the last fifteen or sixteen months again for it; no, not if I knew that I should come out safe at the end, pile and all. But then I am a timid man, and dislike violence; moreover, I am almost sick of adventure. I wonder why I am going to write this book: it is not in my line. I am not a literary man, though very devoted to the Old Testament and also to the \"Ingoldsby Legends.\" Let me try to set down my reasons, just to see if I have any. First reason: Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John","response":"Based on the provided text, King Solomon is associated with mines containing vast riches, specifically diamonds and gold.  The texts describe a legend and a quest to find \"Solomon's Mines,\" implying a historical or mythical association between Solomon and a significant treasure.  One text mentions a document referring to Solomon's treasure chamber.  There's no direct description of what King Solomon *did* in relation to these mines, only that they are named after him and are believed to contain his treasure.\n","_timestamp":1.737368624986999e+09}
